I’m Utkarsh Sinha. I’m a programmer, computer vision researcher, runner, game developer, movie maker and music lover.

I am 25 and specialize in computer vision - specifically with OpenCV and C/C++. I’m always looking for the latest happenings in the field.

I graduated from [BITS-Pilani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani_%E2%80%93_Goa_Campus) with a BE in Computer Science. In the past, I have worked with [Dreamworks Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation)/Technicolor as a Technical Director in San Francisco, CA and [Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore), India.

I'm currently enrolled at the Pittsburgh campus of Carnegie Mellon University as a student of [Computer Vision](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/MSCV).

I’ve lived at many places - Lucknow, Kanpur, Ahmedabad, Gorakhpur, Chennai, New Delhi, Bangalore, and [Menlo Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California), CA.
