I’m Utkarsh Sinha. I’m a programmer, computer vision researcher, runner, game developer, movie maker and music lover.

I am 24 and specialize in computer vision - specifically with OpenCV and C/C++. I’m always looking for the latest happenings

I graduated from [BITS-Pilani](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani_%E2%80%93_Goa_Campus) with a BE in Computer Science and am currently working with Dreamworks Animation/Technicolor as a technical director in Bangalore, India.

In the past, I’ve worked at PDI/Dreamworks and on freelance projects on computer vision.

I’ve lived at many places - Lucknow, Kanpur, Ahmedabad, Gorakhpur, Chennai and New Delhi. I currently live in Bangalore, India.
