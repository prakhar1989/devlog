[AI Shack](http://aishack.in/) is a tutorial/knowlege website. You learn how artificial intelligence works. Not just the theory - but the code as well.

### History
Around 2008 I got interested in computer vision. I learned on my own - the only references I found were lecture slides of universities, documentation (for Matlab and OpenCV) and comments in existing code.

So I put up a few tutorials/articles on basics on my personal blog. These articles grew really popular. If one of them went down for some reason, I’d get messages from people requesting I put them up again. I figured there was a reasonably sized group of people who wanted to know more about computer vision too.

So I setup [AI Shack](http://aishack.in/) in the summer of 2010. Over the years I’ve put up more than 100 tutorials and guides for people. Topics range from basics of computer vision to using neural networks to get stuff done.

Looking back, I think it’s a kind of pay back to the online community. I grew up learning from sites like NeHe, Flipcode and Planet Source Code. I’m sure a lot of it will make much more sense now (those transformation matrices are TOUGH on a 13 year old mind!). I should go through them again!

PS: The ‘shack’ does not come from Radioshack. It was derived from something common in Goa, India.

### Technology
[AI Shack](http://aishack.in/) used wordpress as a platform originally. I built a custom theme (which looks awesome :P) I usually work with OpenCV and C/C++. Currently, it uses a custom Django CMS because the content seemed to outgrow wordpress. The custom CMS implements several custom markdown tags to help with writing tutorials (figures, Latex, info boxes, etc).
