When in the Bay Area (San Francisco to San Jose, California), you're in a unique location - there's ocean, desert, mountains, snow and city - all within a 3 hour drive.

So when planning a trip there, you just have to visit these places:

* The Golden Gate (of course!)
* Fisherman's Wharf
* Shoreline Lake, Mountain View
* Six Flags, Vallejo
* The half dome (at Yosemite National park. Also: the Bridalveil waterfall and the Glacier point)
* South Lake Tahoe (Mr. Rose ski resort is great!)
* Santa Cruz board walk
* The 17 mile drive
