summary: "VideoCopilot releases an iPhone app - and he does it his way. No app has had a better marketing ploy!"

I’ve always loved Andrew Kramer’s website - video copilot. I hadn’t checked a lot of his work over the past few months. I did yesterday. And he has captured my attention me really well - with DemonCam.

This is an app he/his company made. The app itself isn’t that hard to make. What’s amazing his how he approached the marketing aspect - they made an entire epic video to demo the app. You travel centuries and you get to know that an iPhone’s lens is made out of the shards of an ancient orb. Epicness at its epic? Maybe.

If I ever make an app, I’m definitely making a ‘commercial’ like this one.

PS: I think I should get a Z800 too - they’re awesome machines.
