Visiting nature every once in a while is something I've been meaning to do. I finally made time to head to a local peak along with a friend.

The trek was organized by a local trekking group. There were 6 of us there on the trek. Three of us were amatuers - the others were experienced.

Two of them had trekked through several peaks in southern India. One of them had been on a trek through the Himalayas a few years back.

Turns out the person who went to the Himalayas was an [actor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_V._Mashru) in the epic indian crime solving TV show - CID.

**Later on we went rappeling in Ramnagaram (where the classic movie, Sholay, was shot)**
