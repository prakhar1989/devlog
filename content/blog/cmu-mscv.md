I joined Carnegie Mellon's MSCV program last year and it has been a blast.

### Course work
All course work is oriented towards computer vision. The two electives you get should ideally be related to computer vision as well.

### Faculty


Robotics Institute

### Capstone projects
Since this is an industry oriented program you get an opportunity to work with a company on a real computer vision program. Some projects are very research oriented while others have commercialization goals. The faculty is well connected to the industry and you can see it in the range of projects.

### Getting in
Getting into the program is competitive - but given a good background, it shouldn't be hard. I believe the standard advice holds. Have relevant projects.

Students from BITS-Pilani, IIT, IIIT-H and several other Indian universities make it to the program.
