We had Pycon India over the weekend. It was fun! Friday was workshops, followed by two days of intense technical talks.

Outside the talks were booths of prominent technology companies - and all of them had some swag to offer (isn't that the only reason we all go to conferences?).

Luckily, I got the opportunity to speak about my experiences with a web framework called Twisted. This framework allows you to create your own web services - and it can scale pretty well as well. I talked about some of the experiences on scaling up with Twisted.

The conference attracted almost 1500 python enthusiasts from India (some from faraway lands as well). Interacting with people who use Python was fun as well - we discussed topics like datacenters, functional testing and machine learning. If only something like this could happen every month!
