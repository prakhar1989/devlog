I found a way to use OpenCV in everyday life - a thumbnailer. Why is this required, you might ask?

Thumbnails of videos (movies, tv shows, etc) have thumbnails. More often than not, I found that they had the opening sequence for the thumbnail - which is pointless. A thumbnail is supposed to give you a quick summary of what the episode/movie is about. _Enter opencv_

### Useful thumbnails
My definition of useful is if it shows some kind of summary about the show.
